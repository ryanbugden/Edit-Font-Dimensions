# Edit Font Dimensions

A RoboFont extension for manipulating your Font Dimensions directly in Glyph Editor.

## Instructions:
* Install extension.
* Click toolbar icon.
* Decide whether you want to lock the ascender / descender relationship to the UPM or not. If you change the descender and then toggle the check box on, the ascender will snap to the UPMâ€”and vice versa. (this feature idea thanks to Dyana Weissman)
* Move font dimension values. (temporarily selectable as guidelines)
* Exit tool.

## To do:
* Support locking not just asc-desc, but max y and min y, perhaps.
