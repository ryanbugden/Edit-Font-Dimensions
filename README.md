# Edit Font Dimensions

Robofont extension for quickly manipulating your font info’s “Dimensions” values.

## Instructions:
* Install extension once.
* Click toolbar icon.
* Decide whether you want to lock the ascender / descender relationship to the UPM or not. Default is no. If you change the descender and then toggle the check box on, the ascender will snap to the UPM—and vice versa. (this feature idea thanks to Dyana Weissman)
* Move font dimension values. (temporarily selectable as guidelines)
* Exit tool and continue on with your life.

## To do:
* Support locking not just asc-desc, but max y and min y, perhaps.
* Figure out how to save user’s last preference...
