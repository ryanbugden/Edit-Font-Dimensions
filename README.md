# Edit Font Dimensions

<img src="./images/mechanic_icon.png"  width="80">

Edit Font Dimensions is a RoboFont extension that allows you to change your Font Dimensions directly in Glyph Editor.

## How to use:
1. Install extension.
2. Click toolbar icon.
3. Decide whether you keep the ascender-to-descender distance the same as UPM. 
> Note: If you change the descender and _then_ toggle the check box on, the ascender will snap to the UPMâ€”and vice versa. (Thanks to Dyana Weissman for the feature idea!)

4. Move font dimension values. (draggable as guidelines)
5. Exit tool.
